@this code initializes register R0 with the value -5, and then it enters a loop. Inside the loop, it compares the value in R0 with 0 and makes branching decisions based on the result. Depending on the value in R0, it may set the value of R2 to 2, 1, or 3. The loop continues indefinitely, repeatedly executing the instructions from the label COMPARE.

MOV R0,#-5
CMP R0,#0
COMPARE:

BLT L1
MOV R2,#2

MOV R2,#1
